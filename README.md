100 days python coding challenge

Hello everyone! Just to clarify, this is not a copy-paste code. I have thoroughly watched over 100 videos, understood the concepts, and then wrote the code myself. I have advanced knowledge in JavaScript, and my understanding of Java also helped me make this course easier to grasp.

#🔥SPECIAL THNAKS TO YOU ⭐💫💯
