# What is a variable?

b = True
print(type(b))

#What is a Data Type?
# Data type specifies the type of value a variable holds. This is required in programming to do various operations without causing an error.
# In python, we can print the type of any operator using type function:


a = complex(8, 2)
b = True
c = "Harry"
d = None
print(a)
print(b)
a1 = 9
print(a + a1)
print("The type of a is ", type(a))
print("The type of b is ", type(b))
print("The type of c is ", type(c))


list1 = [8, 2.3, [-4, 5], ["apple", "banana"]]
print(list1)

tuple1 = (("parrot", "sparrow"), ("Lion", "Tiger"))
print(tuple1)

dict1 = {"name":"Sakshi", "age":20, "canVote":True}
print(dict1)
